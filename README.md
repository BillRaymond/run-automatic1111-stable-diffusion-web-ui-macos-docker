# run-automatic1111-stable-diffusion-web-ui-macos-docker
Starting point repo that allows you to open your repo as a Dockerfile

This repo assumes you know how to run a Docker container in a macOS M-series chip and use Visual Studio Code's (VSC) Docker and Dev Container extensions.

If you want detailed instructions, go to [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/BillRaymond/74b82f703239480518af1fa67a240d96).

## Pre-requisites
### Software/setup
Before you run this code, make sure you have the following:

1. macOS M-series chip with Ventura (minimum)
2. A [Docker](https://docker.com) account and the Apple Chip Docker desktop installed locally
3. Visual Studio Code for Apple Silicon
4. At minimum, a free [GitHub](https://github.com) account

### Docker configuration
While [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/BillRaymond/74b82f703239480518af1fa67a240d96) will give you more information, I suggest you run the Docker Desktop, go to âš™ `Settings->Resources` and pump up the resources. You can lower them later.

### VSC configuation
1. Install the `Docker` extension from Microsoft
2. Install the `Dev Container` extension from Microsoft

## Clone this repo
1. Run VSC, clone the repo locally and open the folder
2. Type COMMMAND+SHIFT+P and select the `Dev Containers: Open folder in container...` option. Select `Dockerfile` and select `Ok` without selecting any additional options

## Run entrypoint
Even though the Dockerfile provides an `entrypoint`, it will not run by default.

1. In VSC, open a terminal window
2. Type `sh entrypoint.sh`. That will pull the latest code from AUTOMATIC111's Stable Diffusion Web UI (SDWUI) repo and create a new folder with the name `stable-diffusion-web-ui`

## Edit the launch.py file
1. In the VSC Explorer, locate `stable-diffusion-web-ui/launch.py` and open it for editing
2. Locate the following line: `commandline_args = os.environ.get('COMMANDLINE_ARGS', "")` and replace it with:
```
commandline_args = os.environ.get('COMMANDLINE_ARGS', "--skip-torch-cuda-test --opt-sdp-attention --precision full --no-half")
```
